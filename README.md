Hello World! My name is Pira and I am a developing developer, starting from zero (again...)

I began my learning journey a little over 3 years ago, teaching myself during a career break utilising online resources such as freeCodeCamp and codecademy. Alas, life got in the way and after going back to work I let it all slip away from me, but now I am starting over.

I have joined The School of Code Bootcamp 12 and committed to #100DaysOfCode, so looking forward with nervous anticipation to see where this journey takes me!
