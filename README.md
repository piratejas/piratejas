# Hello World! 

**I'm Pira, a self-taught career-switcher and bootcamp graduate who loves to solve problems.**

After a decade in the hospitality industry managing servers and handling client requests, I decided to make the leap into the world of tech and do something completely different... ðŸ˜®

Since graduating from [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/), I have been continuing my learning journey independently and honing my skills through coding challenges, building projects, and lots and lots of console logging.

Now I am looking for the opportunity to prove myself in my first professional role as a ***Junior Full-Stack Software Developer***.

*If you:*

- *have an opening for a creative, enthusiastic and adaptable junior dev*
- *are looking to collaborate on a project*
- *or just want to chat about code, comedy or cryptic crosswords...* 

***Get in touch!*** ðŸ‘‡
