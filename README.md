# Hello World! 

**I'm Pira, a self-taught career-switcher and bootcamp graduate who loves to solve problems.**

After a decade in the hospitality industry managing servers and handling client requests, I decided to make the leap into the world of tech and do something completely different... ðŸ˜…

Since graduating from [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/), I have been continuing my learning journey independently and honing my skills through coding challenges, building projects both personal and collaborative, and lots and lots of console logging.

Now I am looking for the opportunity to prove myself in my first professional role as a ***Junior Full-Stack Software Developer***.
